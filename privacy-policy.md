Last Updated: 01.03.2025

Welcome to Radddio! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). By using Radddio, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

1. Information We Collect

At the moment, we do not collect any personal data from users. Radddio is designed to provide a seamless experience for streaming online radio stations without requiring user registration, personal details, or data collection of any kind.

a) Contacting Us

If you contact us via email, we do not store or collect any information from such communications.

b) Third-Party Services

Radddio may use third-party services for streaming radio content, but we do not track, store, or process any user data through our own systems.

2. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not collect any user data, there is no information to use, store, or process. The App functions solely as a radio streaming platform without personal data collection.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or trade any data, as we do not collect any personal information. However, third-party radio stations or services you interact with through the App may have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

4. Third-Party Links

Radddio may contain links to third-party radio stations and services. These platforms operate independently and have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third parties.

5. Data Security

Since we do not collect any data, there is no risk of data breaches from our end. However, when accessing third-party services through the App, please ensure you review their security and privacy policies.

6. Children's Privacy

Radddio is not intended for children under the age of 13. As we do not collect any personal data, there is no risk of child data being stored. However, parental supervision is recommended when using online services.
